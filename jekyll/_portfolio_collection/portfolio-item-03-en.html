<h3><span class="bg-dark px-3 font-weight-bold">Description</span></h3>
<p>Images.weserv.nl is an image proxy that is free for use to anyone, and we offer it as-is, it's just basic image resizing, available to anyone, easy to use. We try to keep everyone as happy as we can.</p>

<h3><span class="bg-dark px-3 font-weight-bold">History</span></h3>
<p>The project started around 2007 on some spare servers. It was targeted at customers, to be used in websites, web applications and mobile applications. By making it freely available, it saved traffic (through compression) and offloaded the main servers, because customers didn't have to use poor self-written scripts for image resizing.</p>
<p>We gained experience with different user cases, and the separation from the main servers enabled us to use the latest and greatest software stack.</p>

<h3><span class="bg-dark px-3 font-weight-bold">Nowadays</span></h3>
<p>Since 2011 images.weserv.nl is privately funded, and used as a testbed for new techniques in resizing, recognition and processing.</p>
<p>Operating costs of the image proxy are very low. To prevent conflicts of interest, we never accepted payments or donations in any form. Our intend is to keep the service running for many years to come.</p>
